.. readme_inclusion_start

`codata` provides, automatically generated, source files for the lastest codata constants (2018).
The raw codata from http://physics.nist.gov/constants are parsed line by line and converted into
declarations as constants for different languages:

* Fortran module named `fcodata.f90`
* C header named `ccodata.h`
* Python module named `pycodata.py`
* CPython extension named `cpycodata.c`

The sources can be directly included in projects where they are needed.

# Introduction

`pycodata` is a library providing the latest codata constants (2022) and 
older values (2018, 2014 and 2010). 
The raw codata are taken from http://physics.nist.gov/constants.
The constants (values and uncertainties) are implemented as dictionnaries.

# Installation

In a terminal, enter:

```python
pip install pycodata
```

# Usage

The latest values (2022) do not have the year as a suffix in their name. Older values can be used and they feature the year as a suffix in their name.

The latest values are available at the top level and older values are available in dedicated modules.

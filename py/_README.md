# Introduction

Python wrapper around the
[Fortran codata library](https://milanskocic.github.io/codata/ ).
The Fortran library does not need to be installed, the python wrapper embeds all needed fortran dependencies
for Windows and MacOS.
On linux, you might have to install `libgfortran` if it is not distributed by default with your linux distribution. 

# Installation

In a terminal, enter:

```python
pip install pycodata
```

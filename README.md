# Introduction

`codata` provides, automatically generated, source files for the lastest codata constants (2018).
The raw codata from http://physics.nist.gov/constants are parsed line by line and converted into
declarations as constants for different languages:

* Fortran module named codata.f90
* C header named codata.h
* Python module named codata.py
* CPython extension named codata.c

The sources can be directly included in projects where they are needed.

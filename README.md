# Introduction

`codata` is a  Fortran library providing the standard and abridged atomic weights, 
the isotopic abundance and the isotopes' standard atomic weights.
The data are taken from http://ciaaw.org. 
C API allows usage from C, or can be used as a basis for other wrappers.
Python wrapper allows easy usage from Python.

The names are quite long and can be aliased with shorter names.

To use `codata` within your [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) project,
add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:

```
    [dependencies]
    codata = { git="https://github.com/MilanSkocic/codata.git" }
```

**Notes**: 

* The latest codata constants were integrated in the [stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/releases/tag/v0.7.0). The constants are implemented as derived type which carries the name, the value, the uncertainty and the unit. This library will be complementary to the constants defined in the stdlib by providing older values for the constants. 

* If you only need sources for the codata constants that you can integrate directly in your sources you may be interested by https://github.com/vmagnin/fundamental_constants. 


# Dependencies

```
gfortran>=10
fpm>=0.7
stdlib>=0.5
fypp>=3.0
```


# Installation

A Makefile is provided, which uses [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org), for building the library.

* On windows, [msys2](https://www.msys2.org) needs to be installed. 
  Add the msys2 binary (usually C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin) to the path in order to be able to use make.
* On Darwin, the [gcc](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc) toolchain needs to be installed.

Build: the configuration file will set all the environment variables necessary for the compilation

```
    chmod +x configure.sh
    . ./configure.sh
    make
    make install
    make uninstall
```

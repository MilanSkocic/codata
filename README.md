# Introduction

`codata` provides, automatically generated, source files for the lastest codata constants (2018).
The raw codata from http://physics.nist.gov/constants are parsed line by line and converted into
declarations as constants for different languages:

* Fortran module named fcodata.f90
* C header named ccodata.h
* Python module named pycodata.py
* CPython extension named cpycodata.c

The sources can be directly included in projects where they are needed.
